## FolderSpider
Simple app to crawl a directory structure and list files and directories recursively. It uses ZetaLongPaths to overcome System.IO path length limitations.

The application stores the content in a SQL database. Database/table creation is not in this package but the code should be obvious enough to setup a database with two tables.
